# pingproblemfinder
An open-source python tool that allows users to troubleshoot their network troubles in a streamlined way

Instructions on how to use the tool will go here eventually, but for now it is just a description and feature list.

## Features:
- Automatically grab the IP Address of the user's default gateway (typically router)
- Ping the devices for a time specified by the user
- Export all ping data to .txt files for further inspection

## Coming Soon: 
- tracert capability
- detection and reporting of packet loss
- communicating to the end user which device is causing the connectivity issue
- multithreading to allow all processes to run simultaneously and cut down on overall run time
- stress test connections with higher packet sizes
- add instructions on how to locate your ISP gateway / automatically pull the IP for this
